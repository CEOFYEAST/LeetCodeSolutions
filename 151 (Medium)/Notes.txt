Pointers Behavior:
One pointer was used to access each character in the supplied string; this pointer was pushed forward via a for loop.

I was able to solve this problem on my own; however, it became difficult for me because I got pretty caught up in the logic of it. My original submission worked, but it was super inefficient and had two while loops nested inside another while loop. I think taking a break from the problem couldâ€™ve helped me see that a lot of the stuff I used was pretty unnecessary. Also, I still need to get better at optimizing memory.
